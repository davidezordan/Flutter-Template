## Getting Started
### Installing Flutter
You need to install the Flutter SDK by following [this](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) guide.

### Choosing an IDE
Secondly, as a developer you need to choose an IDE (Integrated Developer Environment) that you feel comfortable
developing in. I personally use [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) accompanied with the Flutter plugin for
development. I am more than happy to discuss my reasoning why at any given opportunity. That being said here are some
other favourable environments that are used in Flutter mobile application development.

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)

### Setting up
Once you have successfully cloned the repository it's time to set up your environment.

*Mac OS X*
1. Open your repository in your chosen IDE. (On opening you may see some errors, do not worry.)
2. Open the terminal
3. Navigate inside of the terminal to the cloned directory. It will look like this:
`cd Desktop/Flutter-Template-BP`
4. Once you have successfully navigated there you must run the following command to allow the execution of a script I
wrote to download all of the necessary packages.
`chmod +x get_packages.sh`
5. Then run the following command:
`./get_packages.sh`
6. You should see in the terminal the script is now running and downloading all of the relevant packages to your local disk.

*Windows*

2. Navigate to the cloned repository in File Explorer.
3. double click get_packages.bat.
4. The window will open and then close shortly. Once closed all the relevant packages will have been retrieved.
